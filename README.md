A very rudimentary text-to-html parser which is almost a proper subset of markdown. 

Handles:

- Splitting into paragraphs;
- Headings;
- Nested lists;
- Block and inline code;
- Links and image links;
- Text emphasis; and 
- Escapes

Usage: 

- Run  `yarn parse <path-to-text-file>.txt`
- Appears `<text-file-name>.html` at the root of the project
